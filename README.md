# Trader Portal — Frontend (TradingApp)

Real-time trading portal and admin CRM. Frontend for the `TradingBackend` service.

Built with **Next.js 15** (App Router) · **TypeScript** · **TailwindCSS v4** ·
**Zustand** · **lightweight-charts** (+ TradingView Charting Library scaffold) ·
a reconnecting **WebSocket** client.

> Runs fully standalone: with no backend configured it drives a built-in
> simulated market feed, so every screen is live and interactive out of the box.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and sign in with a demo account (click to autofill on
the login screen):

| Role   | Email            | Password |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------- |
| Trader | trader@demo.com  | `demo`   |
| Admin  | admin@demo.com   | `demo`   |

Other scripts: `npm run build` (production build), `npm start` (serve build),
`npm run lint`.

```

### State management (Zustand)

- `auth-store` — session, login/logout. Persists the user to localStorage and
  mirrors a `tp_session` cookie so middleware can guard routes on the edge.
  Uses `skipHydration` + `AuthHydrator` to keep SSR and client render in sync.
- `market-store` — live quotes, order book, selected symbol, connection status.
- `orders-store` — orders + net positions; `placeOrder` simulates fills.
- `account-store` — account summary + transactions.
- `admin-store` — traders, accounts, rules, activity (+ mutating actions).

### Auth & route protection

`middleware.ts` reads the `tp_session` cookie and:

- redirects unauthenticated users away from `/dashboard|/trade|/orders|/account`
  and `/admin/*` to `/login?next=…`;
- redirects non-admins away from `/admin/*`;
- redirects already-authenticated users off `/login`.

`AuthGuard` mirrors this on the client for consistent UI and role redirects.

## Connecting the TradingBackend

The companion **`TradingBackend`** service streams live futures (ES/NQ/CL/GC)
from Databento. Run it on `:8000`, then this app connects via env (already set in
`.env.local`):

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000/ws
```

Two-terminal dev workflow (start the backend first):

```bash
cd TradingBackend && npm install && npm run dev   # :8000
cd TradingApp     && npm run dev                   # :3000
```

> `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is inlined at build time, so set it before `npm run build` for
> production. Comment it out to use the frontend's own simulated feed.

Expected server → client messages (see `ServerMessage` in `src/lib/types.ts`):

```ts
{ type: "quote",     data: Quote }
{ type: "orderbook", data: OrderBook }
{ type: "order",     data: Order }
{ type: "account",   data: AccountSummary }
{ type: "activity",  data: ActivityEvent }
```

Client → server: `{ type: "subscribe" | "unsubscribe", channel, symbol? }`.

Historical candles are fetched via `GET {httpBase}/api/history?symbol=&resolution=&count=`.
When `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` is unset, all of the above is served by the in-browser
mock feed in `src/lib/mock/`.

## Charts

The trade terminal renders through `AdvancedChart`, which:

- by default uses **lightweight-charts** (TradingView's open-source library) —
  no license required, works immediately;
- when `NEXT_PUBLIC_TV_ADVANCED=1` **and** the licensed **TradingView Charting
  Library** is present in `public/charting_library/`, it loads that instead,
  driven by the datafeed adapter in `src/components/chart/tradingview/datafeed.ts`.

To enable the full Charting Library:

1. Request access at https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library/
2. Copy its build into `public/charting_library/`
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TV_ADVANCED=1`

The library is licensed and intentionally **not** bundled here.

## Purchase flow (ClickFunnels → DB → Make.com → registration)

1. Landing CTAs open ClickFunnels (`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLICKFUNNELS_URL`).
2. On payment, ClickFunnels POSTs to `POST /api/webhooks/clickfunnels` on this app.
3. That route **records the purchase** on TradingBackend (`email` + `orderNumber`) —
   the only way a purchase is ever created — then forwards the event to Make.com.
4. Make emails the buyer a link like `/onboarding?order=ORDER_NUMBER`.
5. Opening that link validates: order exists, status is `PAID`, not yet redeemed.
   Failures redirect home with “Please purchase the subscription.”
6. Completing the wizard (register + purchase confirm) checks the typed email matches
   the purchase, uploads KYC docs, creates the user + onboarding profile, provisions
   an evaluation account, and burns the order (`REDEEMED`).

Standalone `/register` redirects to ClickFunnels; the live register UI is onboarding.

Backend endpoints:

- `POST /api/webhooks/clickfunnels` — record purchase
- `GET /api/purchases/:orderNumber/validate` — page-open gate
- `POST /api/onboarding/complete` — redeem + create user (via app multipart proxy)

Run `npm run db:migrate` in `FutureTradingBackend` after pulling so the `Purchase`
table exists when `DATABASE_URL` is set.

## Notes

- Demo data is deterministic (seeded), so server and client renders match.
- This is the frontend only; business logic, persistence, auth and matching
  belong to `TradingBackend`. The mock layer marks every integration point.
